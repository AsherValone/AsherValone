<p><font size="5"> Cassie has been apart of my life for the past two years now, after my other dog, Charlie, a bluetick hound aged 13, died in 2016 from a malignant tumor. We got Cassie several months after Charlie had passed to fill the empty void in our home that was left after his death. Since adopting Cassie at only 10 weeks she has grown to be a huge part of our lives and we cherish every single waking second we have with her. She still acts like puppy even though she isn't but who's to tell her otherwise?</font></p>
