<p><font size="6">My family is a mostly traditional italian family within Clearwater, Florida. I have always been close to this side of my family, which is my father's side. I have never been close to my mother's side of the family due to the fact that for my whole life I always lived a thousand miles away from all of them. Most of all of my family is or has been involved in business, which is a primary reason that I myself am majoring in business because I already know a good majority about what goes on and what it takes to make it in the business world. My family is and always will be a huge part of my life even if I do no longer live anywhere near them. All of them are always in my heart.
